# Hellify
Make a Programmer's Life A Living Hell
# Usage
Hellify makes a programmer's life hell. It takes lots of important characters in most programming languages
and replaces them with their homoglyphic equivelents. This will cause compilers to throw all sorts of errors
even if the syntax looks completely correct. Please don't hurt me for making this.

The syntax of hellify as follows:

hellify.py [-h] file

The -h argument will display a help message.

The file argument will take an input file to replace characters in.

# How it Works
Hellify is a Python script that uses Perl regex to find and replace characters in a given input file.

The syntax of the find and replace regular expression is as follows:
perl -pi -e 's/firstchar/secondchar/g' file
# Tips
When testing, make a backup for crying out loud.
Please don't be stupid. This was made for shits and giggles, not unemployment.
